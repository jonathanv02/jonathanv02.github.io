<h1>AMD Processors Company</h1>

<h2>What is AMD?</h2>

<p class="AMD-info">AMD is the second largest maker of personal computer microprocessors after Intel. They also make flash memory, integrated circuits for networking devices, and programmable logic devices.</p>
<p class="AMD-info">Intel is one of AMD's biggest competitors since they both make processors for computers</p>

<h2>Bias Opinion</h2>
<p id="bias">AMD is better because I'm broke and do not have a lot of money of my own(if I were to build a PC). Although Intel is more popular and expensive, AMD still do have amazing processors, even if it is cheaper.</p>
